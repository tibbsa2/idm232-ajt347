PHP Stuff 

PHP can act like a regular HTML file but with cool PHP stuff 

Inline PHP <? php echo 'what\'s good!'; ?>
or anywhere on the page 
Can do logic 
will get into databases 


All statements need semicolon to end 

APPS can be hard putting all logic on the same page is sloppy.. 

External files > Linking it <?php include 'filename.fileextension'>
include is a php command to include another file in the read 

Create file once and include it everywhere you need it (good for global design things)

PHP kinda swaggy with the includes. 

Can search for other VSCode PHP extensions

Turn on DEbug mode 
Disable Caching 
PHP Variables 
Numbers 

Will use echo (print) console.log()

AND 

var_dump() 
will tell you info about the varaible to tell you what data type it is
